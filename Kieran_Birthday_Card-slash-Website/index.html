    <p class="bDayMessage">Happy birthday, you beautiful prince o' thieves
      who stole our hearts.<br>
      Wishing you happiness and prosperity throughout the year!<br>
      You've grown so much as a people so quickly, and we're so proud of you.<br>
      <br>
      As you go forward on your journey in life, you'll find ups and lefts and many
       diagonals between those and other unnamed directions.<br>
      <br>
      Remember to take time for relaxing and enjoying yourself.<br>
      You give so much to the people you love, and you deserve so much comfy naptime.<br>
